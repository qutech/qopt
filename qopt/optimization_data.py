"""This module stores information about the optimization and its result.

The `OptimizationResult` is generated with the final properties and initial
optimization parameter values of each optimization run. The
`OptimizationSummary` is only created when requested and stores the properties
of each step in the optimization algorithm. This information is valuable for
the choice of the best optimization algorithm.

Classes
-------
:class:`OptimizationResult`
    Describes the information gained by an optimization run.

:class:`OptimizationSummary`
    Describes the whole information gained during an optimization run.

Notes
-----
The implementation was inspired by the optimal control package of QuTiP [1]_
(Quantum Toolbox in Python)

class OptimizationResult(object):
    """
    Resulting data of the optimization.

    An instance of this class is returned by the `Optimizer` after the
    optimization has terminated. It holds the results of the optimization and
    can also contain an instance of `OptimizationSummary` to describe the
    optimization run itself, for example its convergence.
    The parameters of the initialization method are all optional. This class is
    intended to be initialized empty or loaded from a dictionary by the class
    method :meth:`from_dict`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    termination_reason : string
        Reason for the termination as string.

    status : None or int
        The termination_reason as integer. Like in scipy.OptimizeResult
        None if the optimization has not started.
        -1: improper input parameters status
        0: the maximum number of function evaluations is exceeded.
        1: gradient norm termination condition is satisfied.
        2: cost function termination condition is satisfied.
        3: minimal step size termination condition is satisfied.
        4: Both 2 and 3 termination conditions are satisfied.

    final_cost : float
        Value of the cost functions after the optimization.

    final_grad_norm : float
        Norm of the gradient after the optimization.

    num_iter : integer
        Number of iterations in the optimization algorithm.

    init_parameters : array, shape: (n_t, n_par)
        The amplitudes at the start of the optimisation, where n_t is
        the number of time steps simulated and n_par the number of
        optimization parameters.

    final_parameters : array, shape: (n_t, n_par)
        The optimization parameters at the end of the optimisation, where n_t
        is the number of time steps simulated and n_par the number of
        optimization parameters.

    optimizer : `Optimizer`
        Instance of the `Optimizer` used to generate the result

    optim_summary : `OptimizationSummary`
        None if no intermediary results are saved. Otherwise the infidelity
        during the optimization.
